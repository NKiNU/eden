**1. Overview**

The error ticketing system is designed to manage and track application errors effectively. It logs error tickets generated by the application, providing tools to monitor, analyze, and resolve issues systematically. This documentation serves as a guide for administrators and developers to utilize the system efficiently and integrate it into broader consultive maintenance practices.

**2. Purpose**

i. To facilitate error tracking and resolution.

ii. To ensure system stability and reliability.

iii. To support proactive maintenance and continuous improvement by analyzing error patterns and feedback.

**3. System Features**

3.1 Error Ticket Management

i. View Tickets:

- All error tickets are stored in the errors directory of the application.

- Tickets are sorted by their modification time, with the most recent tickets listed first.

ii. Delete Tickets:

- Administrators can delete error tickets that have been solved

3.2 Error Traceback Analysis

i. Each ticket contains detailed error traceback information to assist developers in diagnosing the root cause of issues.

ii. File-specific traceback and error details are provided to locate the issue in the source code.

3.3 File Path Management

i. The path function is used to retrieve the absolute path of error tickets.

ii. File permissions and secure access are managed to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

**4. Usage Instructions**

ii. Locate the file and line number mentioned in the traceback for debugging.

iii. Use the provided Python code snippets and error context to resolve the issue.

**5. Best Practices**

5.1 Regular Maintenance

- Periodically clean up old tickets to maintain directory hygiene and improve manageability.

- Monitor recurring error patterns and prioritize fixes for frequent issues.

5.2 Security Considerations

- Ensure that access to the errors directory is restricted to authorized personnel.

- Regularly backup error logs before cleanup for future reference or auditing.

**6. Conclusion**

This error ticketing system is a critical component of the applicationâ€™s maintenance process, aiding in proactive troubleshooting and system stability. By following this documentation, administrators and developers can integrate the system into broader consultive maintenance practices to ensure continuous improvement and user satisfaction.
